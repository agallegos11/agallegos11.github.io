          <h2>Byline: Higher Education</h2>
          <p>While at Cookerly Public Relations, I was given the opportunity to write a byline on behalf of a higher education client.

          <p><em>Kicking off this past weekend, Ponce City Market hosts Atlanta Gallery Collective, a pop-up art exhibition celebrating some of the formative members of Atlanta's food scene. The flagship exhibit, a series of portrait photographs captured by Brooklyn-based photographer Erik Tanner, features James Beard Award-winning and nominated chefs and mixologists from the Southeast. Featured in the series are Atlanta-based chefs Linton Hopkins, Hugh Acheson, Greg Best, Asha Gomez, Meherwan Irani, Hector Santiago, and more. <a href="https://creativeloafing.com/content-271931-chefs-in-their-essence-2">Continue reading</a></em></p>
