          <h2>Emory Microtheater</h2>
          <p>During my last year as a student at Emory, I took a playwriting class out of sheer curiosity and love for the genre. I wrote a one-act play and submitted it to the Emory Microtheater Festival, and my play was selected to be performed! Not only was the play performed by Emory students, it was also student-produced and directed.</p>

          <p>Titled <em>Two Quick Shots,</em> the plot follows an unlikely pair of misfits working as assassins in a metropolitan setting. They quickly become faced with a difficult decision that tests their values and their relationship.

          <h2>Writing for Public Relations</h2>
          <p>As a master's student at the University of Miami, I've been granted the opportunity to fine-tune my writing skills and apply them in exercises that will prepare me for the professional world. Under the instruction of stellar professors, I've learned how to write effective pitches and other materials that I will produce during my career.
