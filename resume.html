      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>If you asked me to describe myself, I would tell you I'm curious, authentic and eager to improve in everything I do. During my tenure at Emory University, I participated in a wide variety of creative writing workshops, from Intermediate Playwriting to Creative Nonfiction. Also during that time, I fell in love with Atlanta's vibrant food and drink industry. An editorial internship at Creative Loafing Atlanta led me to discover the beauty of working collaboratively with public relations professionals. I will graduate from the University of Miami in December, after which I plan to start my career as a valuable and effective communicator in the public relations industry.</p>
