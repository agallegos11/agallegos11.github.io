        <p>This is my first web page! Before this class, I had never coded anything before, except for a few bits of basic (and probably archaic) HTML. I know that the tags I learned are archaic because we now use the <strong>strong</strong> tag to make things <strong>bold</strong> and the <em>em</em> tag to <em>italicize</em> things.

        <p>Hereare some interesting facts about me:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>I have two cats. One I rescued off the street in Wynwood, and the other I rescued from a shelter.</li>
          <li>My favorite breakfast food is cheesy grits.</li>
          <li>I just started a lifestyle blog called Sincerely, Allie. You can find me at <a href="https://sincerely-allie.com">Sincerely, Allie</a>.
        </ul>
